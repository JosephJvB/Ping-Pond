Well boy howdy I am glad you have stopped by to read a thing!
How is the reading so far? Directionless you say? To shreds you say?

Yeah alright, I wanna do a lil done thing with random ripples on.

### MVP:

? Do I try to make this with Hapi and sockets ? 
> Use a Hapi server, add sockets later :) ps use redux persist, I dare ya

1. Canvas webpage when you click a ripple appears in a random spot.
2. That ripple expands, loses opacity, then disappears 🌀
3. Then make actual water spew out of the users browser 💦
4. Then make an alethiometer that tells the truth to those smart enough to read it 🔑

Oh and I'm gonna do it from scratch, real MacGyver shizz 😤
