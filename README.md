# Ping-Pond 🌊
Well boy howdy I am glad you have stopped by to read a thing!
How is the reading so far? Directionless you say? To shreds you say?

Yeah alright, I wanna do a lil done thing with random ripples on.

### MVP:

? Do I try to make this with Hapi and sockets ? 
> Use a Hapi server, add sockets later :) ps use redux persist, I dare ya

1. Canvas webpage when you click a ripple appears in a random spot.
2. That ripple expands, loses opacity, then disappears 🌀
3. Then make actual water spew out of the users browser 💦
4. Then make an alethiometer that tells the truth to those smart enough to read it 🔑

### 16/7
So I think it was this morning that I woke up and decided a mini-golf game would be way cooler ⛳️ and Im pretty sure the reason I didnt drop everything and chase that was me being scared about hacky animation using svgs
- having a ping grow small amounts on a tiny interval looks smooth enough 👀
- use 'drag' event to calculate player-swing: { power, direction } and make a ball move based off of that. ye-haw

- Still do more with pings first, maths around screen-y determining radius etc
- oh and keeping pings within a pong would be VERY important to try to hack out ball-bounce mechanics...

So this message is a yes, do mini-golf but not yet
