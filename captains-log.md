### 15/7
Seems like because parcel has a dev-server, I dont need my own Hapi server setup? Yarr tht be takin more grog outta my tankard than i had hoped. BUT in the other corner, I can get right onto front-end dev then build my server up later, yarr.

### 16/7:
  - I can still run my server in parallel and hit it with requests from the client coming off the parcel server, so maybe that's legiiit
setting up jest/enzyme is tricky for a person who doesnt know what they are doing...Packages:
  - enzyme
  - jest
  - babel-jest
  - enzyme-adapter-react-16

And I still cant get the most basic shallow render to behave. I just wanna see my svg element
Ok I can see the svg element.
What I cant do is wrapper.find('<selector>') That is not working
