Seems like because parcel has a dev-server, I dont need my own Hapi server setup? Yarr tht be takin more grog outta my tankard than i had hoped. BUT in the other corner, I can get right onto front-end dev then build my server up later, yarr.
  - I can still run my server in parallel and hit it with requests from the client coming off the parcel server, so maybe that's legiiit
